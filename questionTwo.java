Question 2: You're a spy who received a scrambled message. To decode it, you need to check if the letters can be
rearranged to form a palindrome (reads same forwards and backwards). Can you crack the code?

Examples:
Input: 'aab'        → Output: true  (can form 'aba')
Input: 'carerac'    → Output: true  (can form 'racecar')
Input: 'code'       → Output: false (cannot form palindrome)
